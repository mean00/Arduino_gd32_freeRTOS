 # Arduino_gd32_freeRTOS

**VERY MUCH WORK IN PROGRESS**

This is a "enhanced" version of the Longan nano Riscv board Arduino port.  
What are the differences ?  
* Cmake based build system
* FreeRTOS out of the box, using the port made by QQxiaoming [1]
* Better peripherals thanks to the above
* May not be 100% compatible with the Arduino API

A note of warning : This is my take on what i would like to have/use for such a board
It might not fit your needs.
